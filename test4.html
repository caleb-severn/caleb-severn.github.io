Rawlings’s style was a populism\r\n that connected with the urban youth across Ghana Partly, it was his distaste\r\n for both political camps and his attempt to break the mould of mainstream\r\n politics that explains his dominant role in Ghana’s political life in the\r\n 1980s and 1990s. At heart, Rawlings’s style was a populism that connected\r\n with the urban youth across Ghana, the same constituency that had been fired\r\n up by the anti-colonial struggle and recruited into Nkrumah’s verandah boys\r\n movement. As Ghana shuddered after Rawlings first coup d’état in June 1979,\r\n socialists, radical nationalists and most of all, adherents of Nkrumah, joined\r\n this radical new alliance. Once in power, Rawlings took up the siren call for ‘house cleaning and the ‘war on corruption’.'],
