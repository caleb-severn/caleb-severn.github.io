Officials in Botswana say the  deaths of hundreds of elephants\r\n  in recent months which baffled and alarmed conservationists in the country\r\n were caused by toxins produced by cyanobacteria in water. The government\r\n in the landlocked Southern African country, home to a third of the continent’s\r\n declining elephant population, said in July it had launched an investigation\r\n into the mysterious deaths, collecting samples from the carcasses and mobilising\r\n personnel and aircraft to better understand the situation. “Our latest\r\n tests have detected cyanobacterial neurotoxins to be the cause of deaths.\r\n These are bacteria found in water,” Mmadi Reuben, principal veterinary officer\r\n at the Department of Wildlife and National Parks, told a news conference\r\n on Monday. “However we have many questions still to be answered such as\r\n why the elephants only [died] and why that area only,” he added. “We have\r\n a number of hypotheses we are investigating.” Addressing the same news conference,\r\n Cyril Taolo, the department’s deputy director, said the number of dead\r\n elephants had risen to 330, from 281 last reported in July.'],

The pharmaceutical company, Moderna, which says\r\n its vaccine is 94.1 per cent effective in treating the virus, is applying to\r\n the US Food and Drug Administration for approval. Moderna is one of three\r\n companies making vaccines that seem closest to widespread distribution.
