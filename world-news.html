While export growth was in\r\npart inflated by last years 24 percent\r\ndrop, the outsized gains reinforce the\r\nview that global commerce is recovering from\r\nthe pandemic and increasing Koreas economic expansion\r\n. Annual exports growth will probably be\r\ndoubledigit, Park said . The export\r\ndata showed shipments of chips gained 24.5\r\npercent onyear, rising for an 11th\r\nmonth in a row, while shipments\r\nof cars soared 93.7 percent . Petrochemical\r\nproducts exports surged 94.9 percent from a\r\nyear earlier . Exports to China rose\r\n22.7 percent while total semiconductor shipments increased\r\n24.5 percent . Growth in Asias fourthlargest\r\neconomy was driven by exports of chip\r\nand electronics and a rise in investments'],

								<h2>Monte Carlo Simulation</h2>
							</header>
							
							<p>There are far better explanations online as to how the Monte Carlo simulation works. 
							But I'll do a very short summarised version here. Using the knowledge that the area of a Circle = 4 &#960; r <sup>2</sup> and that the area of a Square = 2r <sup>2</sup>, 
							then we can say that the area of the Circle over the Area of the Square is equal to 4(Points in Cirlce/Points in Square);.
							Below is a visualisation showing the estimated value of &#960; based on how many points you add, you can change the number of points and see how it changes. The more points the more accurate it gets, but at a certain point the computational cost outweighs the benefits. 
							It is worth noting I set the value of the Radius to 2, as it demostrates differences better. </p>

							<p> Below is a form you can use to interact with my Word-2-Vec model. The model is trained using Wikipedia Abstracts.
							NLP cleaning has been run on the abstracts that is different to gensims Word-2-Vec model. Positive values are what you want
							the results to be associated with, negative values are words you do not want the return words to be associated with.
							Please input the words seperated by commas, if you want to utilize bigrams, then connect the words with an "_", for example
							Davd_Attenborough would return the most similar results to instances where David Attenborough is mentioned.</p>
