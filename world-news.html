Minister of Health Nguyen Thanh\r\nLong said on Wednesday Vietnam was nearing\r\nits target of acquiring 150 million doses\r\nof vaccines this year to inoculate 75\r\nof its 98 million population . ’Based\r\non evidence to date, this is\r\nnot a new variant nor a hybrid\r\nvariant but an additional mutation found in\r\nthe Delta variant,’said Kidong\r\nPark, the WHO ’s representative in\r\nVietnam, referring to the Delta variant\r\nfirst identified in India .'],

								<h2>Monte Carlo Simulation</h2>
							</header>
							
							<p>There are far better explanations online as to how the Monte Carlo simulation works. 
							But I'll do a very short summarised version here. Using the knowledge that the area of a Circle = 4 &#960; r <sup>2</sup> and that the area of a Square = 2r <sup>2</sup>, 
							then we can say that the area of the Circle over the Area of the Square is equal to 4(Points in Cirlce/Points in Square);.
							Below is a visualisation showing the estimated value of &#960; based on how many points you add, you can change the number of points and see how it changes. The more points the more accurate it gets, but at a certain point the computational cost outweighs the benefits. 
							It is worth noting I set the value of the Radius to 2, as it demostrates differences better. </p>
