Discover Thomson Reuters By Phuong\r\n Nguyen Khanh Vu 4 Min Read HANOI (Reuters - Vietnam’s\r\n worst single-day coronavirus outbreak so far, its first\r\n for nearly two months, gatecrashed the Communist Party’s\r\n carefully choreographed five-yearly congress on Thursday\r\n - a major headache for a government that has prided itself\r\n on keeping the pandemic at bay. Prime Minister Nguyen\r\n Xuan Phuc urged calm and promised swift action at an\r\n urgently called meeting on the sidelines of the congress.\r\n “We’ll do it fast but calmly, so as not to cause disorder\r\n in people’s lives, and especially to ensure the success\r\n of the congress. Vietnam’s Health Minister Nguyen\r\n Thanh Long told the same meeting that the new outbreak,\r\n centred in a province near Hanoi, could be worse than an\r\n earlier outbreak in the central tourist city of Danang.\r\n Health Minister Long said at the meeting on the sidelines\r\n of the Party congress that Vietnam had so far not seen\r\n so many tests come back positive a total of 72 out of\r\n 138 people to have come into contact with one of the two\r\n new cases reported on Thursday morning tested positive\r\n for the virus, Long said. “We’ve encountered such a problem\r\n many times so we have to stay calm, Prime Minister\r\n Phuc said at Thursday’s emergency meeting, calling for strong measures but not to cause panic.'],

More than 2,000 people died in the uprising before\r\n Saleh in 2012 yielded to pressure from the United States\r\n and Gulf Arab states to step down. Al-Nasr, a poet\r\n with four children, joined government forces when the\r\n Houthis, who later killed Saleh when he turned on them,\r\n entered Taiz, which is still effectively under siege. “We\r\n did not think the uprising would lead to this, said al-Nasr,\r\n who has seen comrades die, his home destroyed and\r\n family scatter. Ali al-Dailami, a rights defender briefly\r\n detained under Saleh’s rule who is now Houthi deputy\r\n minister of human rights, joined the uprising in “Change\r\n Square in Sanaa in the hopes it would lead to a state\r\n representing all.

The whole natural pulse of the river was\r\n missing during the wet season, said Basist, a climatologist\r\n who has done extensive research on water and meteorology\r\n since the 1990s. What was a natural flow before, is\r\n now very irregular, Basist said. A total of 11 upstream\r\n dams are now operating in China. Somkiat, who is also\r\n a member of the inter-governmental Mekong River Commission\r\n (MRC), said more studies were needed to understand\r\n droughts effectively. “The study confirms what locals,\r\n especially those living along the Mekong on Thai-Lao border\r\n in Chiang Rai, have experienced this for over two decades\r\n unusual water fluctuations, she said in an email.\r\n While Basist agreed that weather conditions were the primary\r\n cause for the drought, he said the dam exacerbated the issue.'],

								<h2>Monte Carlo Simulation</h2>
							</header>
							
							<p>There are far better explanations online as to how the Monte Carlo simulation works. 
							But I'll do a very short summarised version here. Using the knowledge that the area of a Circle = 4 &#960; r <sup>2</sup> and that the area of a Square = 2r <sup>2</sup>, 
							then we can say that the area of the Circle over the Area of the Square is equal to 4(Points in Cirlce/Points in Square);.
							Below is a visualisation showing the estimated value of &#960; based on how many points you add, you can change the number of points and see how it changes. The more points the more accurate it gets, but at a certain point the computational cost outweighs the benefits. 
							It is worth noting I set the value of the Radius to 2, as it demostrates differences better. </p>
