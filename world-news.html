In 2019, the nonprofit\r\nEnvironmental Investigation Agency found Vietnams outofcontrol\r\n, illegal wildlife trade had helped drive demand\r\nglobally, and that the Southeast Asian\r\nnation was now the leading destination for\r\nillicit ivory .

								<h2>Monte Carlo Simulation</h2>
							</header>
							
							<p>There are far better explanations online as to how the Monte Carlo simulation works. 
							But I'll do a very short summarised version here. Using the knowledge that the area of a Circle = 4 &#960; r <sup>2</sup> and that the area of a Square = 2r <sup>2</sup>, 
							then we can say that the area of the Circle over the Area of the Square is equal to 4(Points in Cirlce/Points in Square);.
							Below is a visualisation showing the estimated value of &#960; based on how many points you add, you can change the number of points and see how it changes. The more points the more accurate it gets, but at a certain point the computational cost outweighs the benefits. 
							It is worth noting I set the value of the Radius to 2, as it demostrates differences better. </p>

							Please input the words seperated by commas, if you want to utilize bigrams, then connect the words with an "_", for example
