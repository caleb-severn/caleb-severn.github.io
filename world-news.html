Second only to\r\n founding President Kwame Nkrumah, Flight Lieutenant Jerry Rawlings shaped the\r\n country’s trajectory.  Ghana’s former President Jerry Rawlings has died\r\n Many of Ghana’s conservatives will never forgive Rawlings and his cohort for\r\n their attempt to set up a people’s republic in the early 1980s, blaming his\r\n strident leadership for the lives lost and economic descent of that era. \r\n Ghana’s tears, 30 years on An exponent of no-party politics, Rawlings had tried\r\n to bypass the mainstream political divide. Rawlings’s style was a populism\r\n that connected with the urban youth across Ghana Partly, it was his distaste\r\n for both political camps and his attempt to break the mould of mainstream\r\n politics that explains his dominant role in Ghana’s political life in the\r\n 1980s and 1990s. At heart, Rawlings’s style was a populism that connected\r\n with the urban youth across Ghana, the same constituency that had been fired\r\n up by the anti-colonial struggle and recruited into Nkrumah’s verandah boys\r\n movement. As Ghana shuddered after Rawlings first coup d’état in June 1979,\r\n socialists, radical nationalists and most of all, adherents of Nkrumah, joined\r\n this radical new alliance. Once in power, Rawlings took up the siren call for ‘house cleaning and the ‘war on corruption’.'],
