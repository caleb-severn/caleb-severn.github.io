The United Kingdom has\r\nslapped sanctions on four Zimbabwean security officials\r\nover alleged human rights abuses, in\r\na move that will restrict their travel\r\nto Britain and freeze their assets .\r\nThese sanctions send a clear message that\r\nwe will hold to account those responsible\r\nfor the most egregious human rights violations\r\n, including the deaths of innocent Zimbabweans\r\n, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in\r\na statement . These sanctions target senior\r\nindividuals in the government, and not\r\nordinary Zimbabweans . Ncube and Sanyatwe were\r\nalready targeted for United Sanctions sanctions in\r\nMarch last year . Reacting to the\r\nnews, government spokesman Nick Mangwana wrote\r\non Twitter that none of the four\r\nsanctioned Zimbabwe officials have assets in the\r\nUK, nor have they showed any\r\ninterest in travelling there in the last'],

								<h2>Monte Carlo Simulation</h2>
							</header>
							
							<p>There are far better explanations online as to how the Monte Carlo simulation works. 
							But I'll do a very short summarised version here. Using the knowledge that the area of a Circle = 4 &#960; r <sup>2</sup> and that the area of a Square = 2r <sup>2</sup>, 
							then we can say that the area of the Circle over the Area of the Square is equal to 4(Points in Cirlce/Points in Square);.
							Below is a visualisation showing the estimated value of &#960; based on how many points you add, you can change the number of points and see how it changes. The more points the more accurate it gets, but at a certain point the computational cost outweighs the benefits. 
							It is worth noting I set the value of the Radius to 2, as it demostrates differences better. </p>

							Please input the words seperated by commas, if you want to utilize bigrams, then connect the words with an "_", for example
							Davd_Attenborough would return the most similar results to instances where David Attenborough is mentioned.</p>
