Discover Thomson Reuters By Yimou Lee 3 Min Read TAIPEI (Reuters\r\n - Foxconn is moving some iPad and MacBook assembly to Vietnam from China at\r\n the request of Apple Inc, said a person with knowledge of the plan, as the\r\n U.S. firm diversifies production to minimise the impact of a Sino-U.S. trade\r\n war. The development comes as the outgoing administration of U.S. President\r\n Donald Trump encourages U.S. firms to shift production out of China. The\r\n lines will also take some production from China, the person said, without elaborating\r\n how much production would shift. “The move was requested by Apple,\r\n the person said. Other iPad assemblers include Taiwan’s Compal Electronics\r\n Inc and China’s BYD Electronic International Co Ltd.'],
