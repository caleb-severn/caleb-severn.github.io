Now, hopes are high that\r\na vaccine rollout could bring back muchneeded\r\ntourism in the resort town but for\r\nsome holiday businesses, it might take\r\nmore than just a COVID19 shot to\r\nrecoup the losses in a country that\r\nhas been in the throes of a\r\nsevere economic crisis .

								<h2>Monte Carlo Simulation</h2>
							</header>
							
							<p>There are far better explanations online as to how the Monte Carlo simulation works. 
							But I'll do a very short summarised version here. Using the knowledge that the area of a Circle = 4 &#960; r <sup>2</sup> and that the area of a Square = 2r <sup>2</sup>, 
							then we can say that the area of the Circle over the Area of the Square is equal to 4(Points in Cirlce/Points in Square);.
							Below is a visualisation showing the estimated value of &#960; based on how many points you add, you can change the number of points and see how it changes. The more points the more accurate it gets, but at a certain point the computational cost outweighs the benefits. 
							It is worth noting I set the value of the Radius to 2, as it demostrates differences better. </p>

							NLP cleaning has been run on the abstracts that is different to gensims Word-2-Vec model. Positive values are what you want

							Please input the words seperated by commas, if you want to utilize bigrams, then connect the words with an "_", for example
							Davd_Attenborough would return the most similar results to instances where David Attenborough is mentioned.</p>
