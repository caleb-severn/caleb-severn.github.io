European progressives\r\n should see CARICOM’s latest call for reparations as a call to action.\r\n Britain has heard the call for reparations and ignored it for decades. And\r\n that is what the case for reparations is about self-determination. On July\r\n 6, Caribbean Community (CARICOM an organisation of 15 countries in the Caribbean\r\n – renewed its calls for reparations, emphasising their importance for the\r\n second stage of independence in the Caribbean. First, because the case for\r\n reparations, inspired by the works of thinkers like CLR James, Eric Williams,\r\n and Walter Rodney, is itself rooted in radical West Indian tradition that\r\n led to the agitation of African and Caribbean independence, and is indeed\r\n a continuation of that struggle. If the Caribbean right now is advancing the\r\n cause for reparations, then we need to bring that frame of thought and action\r\n back. Cambridge ought to deal with Beckles not in his capacity as UWI\r\n vice chancellor but as the chairman of the CARICOM reparations commission.'],
