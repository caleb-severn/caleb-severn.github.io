Kaunda, 97, asks for prayers as\r\nhe receives treatment for an undisclosed illness\r\nat a military hospital in Lusaka .\r\nZambias former President Kenneth Kaunda is receiving\r\ntreatment for an undisclosed illness at a\r\nmilitary hospital in the capital Lusaka ,\r\nhis office has said, as the\r\nSouthern African country battles a surge in\r\nCOVID19 cases . The 97yearold ruled Zambia\r\nfrom 1964, when the country won\r\nits independence from Britain, until 1991\r\n. His administrative assistant Rodrick Ngolo said\r\nin a statement on Monday that Kaunda\r\nhad been feeling unwell and had been\r\nadmitted to the Maina Soko Medical Centre\r\nin Lusaka . Though the short statement\r\ndid not specify Kaundas illness, Zambia\r\nis experiencing a surge in COVID19 cases\r\n. During his rule, Kaunda made\r\nZambia a centre for anticolonial groups fighting\r\nto end white minority rule in Southern\r\nAfrican countries, including Namibia, South'],

								<h2>Monte Carlo Simulation</h2>
							</header>
							
							<p>There are far better explanations online as to how the Monte Carlo simulation works. 
							But I'll do a very short summarised version here. Using the knowledge that the area of a Circle = 4 &#960; r <sup>2</sup> and that the area of a Square = 2r <sup>2</sup>, 
							then we can say that the area of the Circle over the Area of the Square is equal to 4(Points in Cirlce/Points in Square);.
							Below is a visualisation showing the estimated value of &#960; based on how many points you add, you can change the number of points and see how it changes. The more points the more accurate it gets, but at a certain point the computational cost outweighs the benefits. 
							It is worth noting I set the value of the Radius to 2, as it demostrates differences better. </p>

							Please input the words seperated by commas, if you want to utilize bigrams, then connect the words with an "_", for example
