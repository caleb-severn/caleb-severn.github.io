First, because the case for\r\n reparations, inspired by the works of thinkers like CLR James, Eric Williams,\r\n and Walter Rodney, is itself rooted in radical West Indian tradition that\r\n led to the agitation of African and Caribbean independence, and is indeed\r\n a continuation of that struggle.
