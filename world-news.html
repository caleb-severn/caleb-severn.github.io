The challengers to Trump’s July directive include various states led\r\n by New York, cities, counties and immigrant rights groups.

If California loses House districts, that likely would mean Democrats\r\n lose House seats, benefiting Republicans. There are an estimated 11\r\n million immigrants living in the United States illegally. The U.S. Constitution\r\n requires the apportionment of House seats to be based upon the “whole\r\n number of persons in each state.
