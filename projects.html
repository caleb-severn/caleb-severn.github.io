The 97yearold ruled Zambia\r\nfrom 1964, when the country won\r\nits independence from Britain, until 1991\r\n. His administrative assistant Rodrick Ngolo said\r\nin a statement on Monday that Kaunda\r\nhad been feeling unwell and had been\r\nadmitted to the Maina Soko Medical Centre\r\nin Lusaka . Though the short statement\r\ndid not specify Kaundas illness, Zambia\r\nis experiencing a surge in COVID19 cases\r\n. During his rule, Kaunda made\r\nZambia a centre for anticolonial groups fighting\r\nto end white minority rule in Southern\r\nAfrican countries, including Namibia, South'],

								<h2>Monte Carlo Simulation</h2>
							</header>
							
							<p>There are far better explanations online as to how the Monte Carlo simulation works. 
							But I'll do a very short summarised version here. Using the knowledge that the area of a Circle = 4 &#960; r <sup>2</sup> and that the area of a Square = 2r <sup>2</sup>, 
							then we can say that the area of the Circle over the Area of the Square is equal to 4(Points in Cirlce/Points in Square);.
							Below is a visualisation showing the estimated value of &#960; based on how many points you add, you can change the number of points and see how it changes. The more points the more accurate it gets, but at a certain point the computational cost outweighs the benefits. 
							It is worth noting I set the value of the Radius to 2, as it demostrates differences better. </p>

							Please input the words seperated by commas, if you want to utilize bigrams, then connect the words with an "_", for example
