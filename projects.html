The\r\ncompany will end production and sales of\r\nmobile phone products on July 31 to\r\nfocus resources on growth areas including electric\r\nvehicles EVs, smart homes, robotics\r\nand artificial intelligence, it said in\r\na statement . It will strengthen its\r\ncar parts business and continue to develop\r\nmobile technologies such as sixthgeneration networking\r\nand cameras, it said . Its decision\r\nto pull out will leave its 10percent\r\nshare in North America, where it\r\nis the thirdlargest brand, to be\r\ngobbled up by Samsung Electronics and Apple\r\nInc with its domestic rival expected to\r\nhave the edge .

								<h2>Monte Carlo Simulation</h2>
							</header>
							
							<p>There are far better explanations online as to how the Monte Carlo simulation works. 
							But I'll do a very short summarised version here. Using the knowledge that the area of a Circle = 4 &#960; r <sup>2</sup> and that the area of a Square = 2r <sup>2</sup>, 
							then we can say that the area of the Circle over the Area of the Square is equal to 4(Points in Cirlce/Points in Square);.
							Below is a visualisation showing the estimated value of &#960; based on how many points you add, you can change the number of points and see how it changes. The more points the more accurate it gets, but at a certain point the computational cost outweighs the benefits. 
							It is worth noting I set the value of the Radius to 2, as it demostrates differences better. </p>

							NLP cleaning has been run on the abstracts that is different to gensims Word-2-Vec model. Positive values are what you want
							the results to be associated with, negative values are words you do not want the return words to be associated with.
							Please input the words seperated by commas, if you want to utilize bigrams, then connect the words with an "_", for example
							Davd_Attenborough would return the most similar results to instances where David Attenborough is mentioned.</p>
