								<h2>Monte Carlo Simulation</h2>
							</header>
							
							<p>There are far better explanations online as to how the Monte Carlo simulation works. 
							But I'll do a very short summarised version here. Using the knowledge that the area of a Circle = 4 &#960; r <sup>2</sup> and that the area of a Square = 2r <sup>2</sup>, 
							then we can say that the area of the Circle over the Area of the Square is equal to 4(Points in Cirlce/Points in Square);.
							Below is a visualisation showing the estimated value of &#960; based on how many points you add, you can change the number of points and see how it changes. The more points the more accurate it gets, but at a certain point the computational cost outweighs the benefits. 
							It is worth noting I set the value of the Radius to 2, as it demostrates differences better. </p>

							<p> Below is a form you can use to interact with my Word-2-Vec model. The model is trained using Wikipedia Abstracts.
							NLP cleaning has been run on the abstracts that is different to gensims Word-2-Vec model. Positive values are what you want
							the results to be associated with, negative values are words you do not want the return words to be associated with.
							Please input the words seperated by commas, if you want to utilize bigrams, then connect the words with an "_", for example
							Davd_Attenborough would return the most similar results to instances where David Attenborough is mentioned.</p>
