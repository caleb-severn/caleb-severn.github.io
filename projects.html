The New Yorkbased\r\nCommittee to Protect Journalists CPJ said on\r\nFriday the baseless charges against Jeffrey Moyo\r\n, a New York Times freelancer who\r\nhas also worked for other international media\r\noutlets, including The Globe and Mail\r\n, should be dropped . His lawyer\r\n, Doug Coltart, told the CPJ\r\nMoyo was charged with violating Section 36\r\nof the Immigration Act for allegedly presenting\r\nfalse information to immigration officials to help\r\ntwo New York Times journalists enter the\r\ncountry . In a statement on Facebook\r\n, the ZMC said that the two\r\nNew York Times reporters had applied for\r\nclearance to work in the country but\r\ntheir application was denied by the responsible\r\nauthorities . The fact that he was\r\narrested, and his New York Times\r\ncolleagues forced to leave the country ,\r\nshows that Zimbabwe continues to violate the\r\nright to press freedom and the publics\r\nright to know . The New York\r\nTimes said in a statement We are\r\ndeeply concerned by Jeffrey Moyos arrest and\r\nare assisting his lawyers to secure his'],

								<h2>Monte Carlo Simulation</h2>
							</header>
							
							<p>There are far better explanations online as to how the Monte Carlo simulation works. 
							But I'll do a very short summarised version here. Using the knowledge that the area of a Circle = 4 &#960; r <sup>2</sup> and that the area of a Square = 2r <sup>2</sup>, 
							then we can say that the area of the Circle over the Area of the Square is equal to 4(Points in Cirlce/Points in Square);.
							Below is a visualisation showing the estimated value of &#960; based on how many points you add, you can change the number of points and see how it changes. The more points the more accurate it gets, but at a certain point the computational cost outweighs the benefits. 
							It is worth noting I set the value of the Radius to 2, as it demostrates differences better. </p>
